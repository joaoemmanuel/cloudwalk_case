## Useful information for risk analysis:
<ul>
    <li>Transaction Type</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Information like transaction type would be useful when analysing transaction behavior.
            A food delivery order at 2am is not something suspicious, while a money transfer is.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>First Transaction Flag</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A first transaction flag would help identify suspicious transactions when analyzed along with value, time of transaction, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    <li></li>
